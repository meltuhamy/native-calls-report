# Native Calls Report

This is the final individual project report for the [Native Calls](https://github.com/meltuhamy/native-calls) project.

The project is part of my fourth year MEng degree at Imperial College.

## Building

You can build the project using latex, bibtex and pdflatex. You will therefore need to have these on your system.

To ease development, you can use [latex-watcher](https://github.com/meltuhamy/latex-watcher). This has been integrated with a Makefile. To use the Makefile, you will need to have node installed. 

Once node is installed, you can simply run ```make``` to build the pdf.

Or, you can run ```make watch``` to continously make and build the project every time the tex file changes.
