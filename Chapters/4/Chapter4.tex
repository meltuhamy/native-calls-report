\lhead{Chapter 4. \emph{Design}} 

This section gives an overview of the design of our RPC framework and generator. The main design decisions were regarding three different issues. These are

\begin{itemize}
	\item The overall RPC framework structure. This refers to how the RPC framework is split up into different layers, and the design issues of each layer.
	\item WebIDL bindings, and the issues involved with implementing reasonable bindings for JavaScript and C++.
	\item Generating RPC code using WebIDL.
\end{itemize}
