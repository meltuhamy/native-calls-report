\section{Evaluation Conclusion} % (fold)
\label{sec:eval_usability_conclusion}
After looking at two different applications, we can see that for static or singleton-based applications, such as the bullet physics application, the Native Calls library and generators saves a lot of development time and provides a natural, straight forward method of implementing a C++ library usable from JavaScript. However, for object oriented applications, we find that the JavaScript and C++ developer must think about implementing low level details such as instance look up in order to give a object oriented RPC system.

As for performance, we find that the performance impact is negligible for RPC calls with little data. The impact increases with increasing data size.

This makes using Native Calls perfect for singleton-based applications which send and receive little data, while a trade-off must be made for object-oriented applications or applications that send and receive large data.
