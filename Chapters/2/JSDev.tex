\label{sec:javascript_development}
Since JavaScript is ``the world's most misunderstood language''\footnote{\url{http://javascript.crockford.com/javascript.html}} (according to Douglas Crockford, author of JavaScript: The Good Parts\cite{crockfordjavascript}), this section briefly describes the main features of the language, as well as common design and development patterns.

JavaScript is a dynamic, object oriented language. It was originally designed to run on web browsers, but it has gained popularity and is now used in many other domains, including server side development using node.js.

\subsection{Types} % (fold)
\label{sub:js_types}
JavaScript has primitive types, passed by value, as well as reference data types.

The primitive types are \lstinline+string+, \lstinline+number+, \lstinline+boolean+, \lstinline+Null+ and \lstinline+Undefined+. Number types can be integer or floating-point, but internally all numbers are floating point values.

Reference types include Objects and Arrays.
